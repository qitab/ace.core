;;; The module provides CLOS based functionality useful to define hooks.
;;; The DEFINE-HOOK-FUNCTION is a macro that defines a generic-function
;;; which uses the HOOK:COMBINATION of methods that is different from the
;;; standard combination. The main difference is that it allows to specify
;;; a hook "identifier" and thus allows to chain multiple methods with the
;;; same specializers, which is not possible with the standard combination.
;;; Another feature is that the HOOK:COMBINATION allows to specify
;;; SEQUENCE numbers, or :AFTER and :BEFORE qualifiers useful in ordering
;;; the methods in a hook function invocation.
;;; For more information on combination methods please refer to:
;;; http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/CLHS/Body/m_defi_4.htm

                                                   default-method)
  "Defines a generic function under the name HOOK-FUNCTION.
 The generic function uses HOOK:COMBINATION and accepts HOOK:METHODS.
 ARGS - are the arguments for the hook function to be passed to the methods.
 OPERATOR - is the operator used to combine the methods which is by default PROGN.
 ORDER - allows to sort the hook methods and defaults to :MOST-SPECIFIC-FIRST.
 DOCUMENTATION - adds a documentation string to the generic function.
 DEFAULT-METHOD - if non-nil, will add a default method with the specified body.

 The hook methods are combined using the HOOK:COMBINATION as follows.
 Each of the hook methods require a specific method qualifier pattern:
   symbol number
 or
   symbol [:after qualifier*] [:before qualifier*]
 or
   symbol :around qualifier*

 Each pattern starts with a symbol that is the hook method identifier.

 The first pattern adds a primary method to the hook function.
 Hook methods with a number as the second qualifier are ordered according to
 their number with 0 being the default for other methods.

 The second pattern form also adds a primary method to the hook function.
 If the symbol identifier is followed by an :AFTER or :BEFORE keyword,
 the method invocation is ordered after or before the methods named
 by the rest of the symbols following :AFTER or :BEFORE.
 Since, methods with :AFTER or :BEFORE qualifiers have a sequence number of 0,
 they are ordered after all methods with negative sequence numbers and before
 all methods with positive sequence numbers.

 The third pattern using an :around qualifier will insert the method
 around the invocation of all the methods named by the rest of symbols
 following the :AROUND keyword.
 The around methods have a CALL-NEXT-METHOD function defined.

 Example:
  (define-hook-function at-query-start (query)
   :documentation \"Methods called when a QUERY is about to be processed.\")

  (defmethod at-query-start check-parameters (query)
    \"The method is called at query start time to check parameters of the QUERY.\"
    ...)

 Example:
  This example uses the HOOK:AT-RESTART hook function.
  (defmethod hook:at-restart init-foo () ...)
  (defmethod hook:at-restart write-restart :before init-foo () (write-string \"RESTART\"))
  (defmethod hook:at-restart log-init-foo :around init-foo ()
     (write-string \"Before INIT-FOO\")
     (call-next-method)
     (write-string \"After INIT-FOO\"))

  This defines three hook methods called after the image was restarted.
  The first one (init-foo) initializes some functionality foo.
  The second (write-restart) is called before INIT-FOO and writes RESTART to the standard output.
  The third (log-init-foo) is an around method for the INIT-FOO hook method.

  Calling (hook:at-restart) would invoke all the three hook methods."
