(defmacro define-constant (name value &key (test '#'equal) documentation)
  "Defines a constant NAME with the VALUE.
When the constant NAME is redefined, the TEST predicate is used to compare
the new VALUE with the previous one for changes. An error is signaled
if the TEST does not return true for both values.
Unlike DEFCONSTANT, this allows to define constants using different
equality predicates than EQL. This allows lists and other objects
to be regarded as constants.

Parameters:
 NAME - the name of the new constant.
 VALUE - the value for the constant.
 TEST - test predicate function to compare the old and new values
   in case the constant is redefined. Default is #'EQUAL.
 DOCUMENTATION - attaches a documentation string the constant name.

Example:
  (define-constant +fields+ '(a b c)
   :test #'equalp :documentation 'Fields used in...')

(defmacro clet ((&rest clauses) &body body)
  "Binds variables defined in CLAUSES and when one is NIL, it stops.

CLAUSES have the form (VARS . FORMS).
The last form of the FORMS is the INIT-FORM providing values for the bindings.
Each clause creates a binding in succession similar to LET*.
The FORMS of later clauses can thus refer to previous bindings.

Example:
 (CLET ((sum (and a b (+ a b)))
        (c (format t \"SUM: ~A~%\" sum)
           (unless (zerop sum)
             (/ (- a b) sum))))
    ;; Evaluates the body only if A and B are non-NIL
    ;; and when the SUM is non-zero.
    ;; Second clause will output the SUM unless A or B is NIL.
    ...)

VARS can be a symbol. In this case the first value is assigned and checked.
If this value is NIL, the clause fails and the whole CLET form returns NIL.

VARS can be a list of symbols. In this case the values returned by
the INIT-FORM are used to bind to the VARS. If all the bound values are NIL,
the clause fails and CLET returns NIL.

Example:
 (CLET ((key (make-key x y z))
        ((value have) (gethash key table)))
   ;; Evaluates the body when KEY is non-NIL
   ;; and when either the VALUE or HAVE binding is non-NIL.
   ...)

Thus CLET has an implicit AND-OR schema,
with clauses in an AND-relation, and with the values of
multiple-value binding clauses in an OR-relation.

If a clause is just a variable name - i.e. not a CONS -
then the variable is bound to NIL and the evaluation continues.
